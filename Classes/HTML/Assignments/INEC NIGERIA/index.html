        <strong>Message from the INEC Chairman</strong>
        <p>
            I am delighted to announce the official commencement of the Continuous Voters Registration Exercise Nationwide. This exercise is an essential step in ensuring your active participation in the upcoming elections, and we encourage all eligible voters to take part. This phase of the CVR exercise will run from Monday August 18, 2025(Online) to Wednesday December 10, 2025. Physical/On-site registration at any of the registration centres starts on Monday August 25, 2025.
            <br>
            <br>
            This exercise will allow registration of new voters at any of the designated registration points. For those already registered as voters, it will allow for update of voter information, transfer of their voter record to another location. During this period, registered voters in Anambra State, who have not collected their PVCs, can conveniently obtain them at designated collection centers.
            <br>
            <br>
            To facilitate a seamless process, we have launched a feature on the CVR portal where voters can check the status of their voter cards, find the location of their designated pickup center, and for those not previously registered, locate the nearest registration centres.
            <br>
            <br>
            Your PVC is your key to making your voice heard in our democratic process. We urge every eligible voter, in these states, to seize this opportunity to register, update their information, collect their PVCs and actively participate in shaping their future.
            <br>
            <br>
            Thank you for your continued commitment to our democracy, and we look forward to your active engagement in the electoral process.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Professor Mahmood Yakubu</strong>
